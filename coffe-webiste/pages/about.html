                <p>There are many different coffee drinks enjoyed around the world, each offering its own flavor, strength, and style. Popular types include <b>espresso</b>, a strong and concentrated shot that serves as the base for many drinks; <b>americano</b>, which combines espresso with hot water for a smoother taste; <b>latte and cappuccino</b>, both made with espresso and steamed milk but with different levels of foam; and <b>mocha</b>, a sweet blend of espresso, chocolate, and milk. These drinks vary in texture, intensity, and sweetness, giving coffee lovers plenty of options to match their personal taste.</p>

            <h3>How Each Drink Is Made<br>(Unique Characteristics)</h3>
            <p>
                Each coffee drink is made in its own way, giving it a unique character and flavor. <b>Espresso</b> is created by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee, producing a strong and concentrated shot with a rich crema. When this shot is mixed with hot water, it becomes an <b>Americano</b>, which is smoother and lighter yet still richer than regular brewed coffee. Adding steamed milk and a thin layer of foam transforms espresso into a <b>Latte</b>, known for its creamy and mild taste, while a <b>Cappuccino</b> uses equal parts espresso, milk, and foam to create a stronger flavor with a light, airy texture. For those who enjoy sweeter drinks, the <b>Mocha</b> blends espresso with chocolate and steamed milk to deliver a dessert-like coffee experience. A <b>Macchiato</b> keeps the intensity of espresso but adds just a touch of milk for slight softness.Together, these drinks showcase how small variations in ingredients and technique can create entirely different coffee experiences.

                <h4>Coffe Beans Arabica vs Robusta</h4>
                <p>When it comes to coffee beans, the two most widely used varieties are <b>Arabica</b> and <b>Robusta</b>, each offering distinct flavors and characteristics.<b>Arabica</b> beans are known for their smooth, refined taste with notes that can range from fruity to floral, making them the preferred choice for high-quality and specialty coffees. They grow at higher altitudes and require more care, which contributes to their premium flavor and higher price. In contrast, <b>Robusta</b> beans have a stronger, bolder, and more bitter profile, often described as earthy or nutty. They contain nearly twice as much caffeine as Arabica and are more resistant to pests and harsh climates, making them easier and cheaper to cultivate. While Arabica delivers complexity and aroma, Robusta provides intensity, crema, and a powerful kick, which is why many espresso blends combine both to achieve balance and depth.</p>
